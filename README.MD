Unsolved problems (if any):



Future (Ice Box) Features





Necessary Deliverables:

*A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted on Heroku.

*A git repository hosted on Github for your app with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of your project. Commit early, commit often!

*A Trello board with:
User Stories, each moving from left to right in the following three lists in your board:
Ice Box
Current/MVP
Completed.

User Stories must follow the following template:
As a <user role>, I want <feature>, because <reason>.
The reason is optional if it's blatantly obvious.

Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

*Wireframes of your UI.

*An ERD showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them. Here's a YouTube video to show you how.



Technical Requirements:

Your app must:

Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "user" Model. 

One model that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main model (embedded or referenced).

Use OAuth authentication. 

Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.

Have complete CRUD data operations.

Be styled with well-organized and DRY CSS.

Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, your app may: Consume a third-party API. Expose its own data resources as JSON via an API.
