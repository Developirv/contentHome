Future (Ice Box) Features





Necessary Deliverables

A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted on Heroku.
A git repository hosted on Github for your app with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of your project. Commit early, commit often!


A Trello board with:
User Stories, each moving from left to right in the following three lists in your board:
Ice Box
Current/MVP
Completed. Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.
Wireframes of your UI.
An ERD showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them. Here's a YouTube video to show you how.
User Stories must follow the following template:
As a <user role>, I want <feature>, because <reason>.
The reason is optional if it's blatantly obvious.





Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "user" Model. One model that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main model (embedded or referenced).
Use OAuth authentication. (lesson this week)
Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.
Have complete CRUD data operations.
Be styled with well-organized and DRY CSS.
Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, your app may:

Consume a third-party API.
Expose its own data resources as JSON via an API.
